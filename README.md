## My process
Analyse the design file and think through what needs to be built in terms of component. 

My approach is builting from "out to in", step as follow:

Desktop:
1. built the html portion for the beige background, then css for the same section
2. built html portion for the product card, then css for the same section
3. built the left & right portion of card in html, then followed by css on styling

Mobile: 
1. Identify the component from desktop version that can be reused, and style the remaining that unable to reuse

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### Useful resources

- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This help me with all the html tag and CSS syntax. All the interactive guides are using useful in helping me identify what was required to complete this project
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Alternative to the above guide
